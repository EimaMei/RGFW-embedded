TODO (in no particular order):
- README.md guide on creating a console backend.
- Document all macros.
- Convert RGFW_ALLOC_SYS/RGFW_FREE_SYS to proper functions.
- (3DS) Resize event.
- (3DS) Fix flicker when exiting apps using buffer rendering.
- (3DS) Fix flicker when opening standard buffer.
- Update Makefiles to be better, have a 'compile_examples' command.
- (3DS) Add debug info for initialized and freed context.
- Make a template for each embedded platform.
- Document all examples.
- Finish the callbacks example with video mode change callback.
- Document how not specifying a graphical API will make Embedded fallback to other ones.
- Document examples/README.md
- Update CHANGELOG
- Add changes from Desktop to Embedded
- add a gyro example.
- (3DS) Add anti-aliasing for OpenGL.
- (3DS) Update GLASS, libctru and other 3ds dependencies.
- (3DS) Add documentation for OpenGL support and how it requires GLASS and a forked
version of libctru.
- (3DS) Implement 'GSPGPU_SetLcdForceBlack' using the "showWindow" functions. Add
back the window flags for it.
- Implement a show flag.
- Add an example where the "non-primary" screen is only used.
- Add a sizeof and getters/setters for each opaque struct type.
- Rework debug systems to be more flexible.
- swapInterval example
- Implement better header guard.
- Pick a better name for RGFW Embedded.
- Add timestamp to events.
- Controller battery event (battery update, dead, etc).
- Document all RGFW_<PLATFORM> macros.
- Linked list for controllers.
- Add ways to disable certain events.
- Add "update complete" event.
- Add a "end poll" event and function.
- (Wii) GameCube controller support.
- Update basic example to not use "motion_enable" once the abbility to disable events is present.
- "Update controller" function (see SDL).
- Update controller axes/motions/pointers/buttons/etc functions (see above).
- Enable "pointer" for basic example.
- Add a controller event that'd notify the user of specific events. For wii it'd be adding/removing extensions to the wii remote.
- (3DS) Add an error if the users selects RGFW_videoModeWide on non 3DS and New 2DS XL consoles.
- Get region (NTSC/PAL?) function.
- Get cable function.
- Add a window flag to use native mode instead.
- Make "setNative" alloc non-native buffers if false is specified and buffers are null.
- (3DS) RGFW_windowMakeCurrentBuffer should call "present" function
- (Wii) Fix bug where nunchuk controllers are eligible for gyroscope support.
- (Wii) Add video refresh event.
- (3DS) Add video refresh event.
- Remove swapBuffers in the callbacks example and replace it with a video fresh event.
- Add rumble functionality.

Maybe:
- (3DS) Find a way to not use gfxInitDefault for GLASS.
- OpenGL hint to request specific values instead of relying on minimums.
- RGFW_window_swapInterval for buffer rendering.
- Knob?
- Add angle to sensor.
- Replace wpad code with wiiuse.
- (Wii) Add a "fade out" effect when exiting.

Distant TODO:
- Create a portable stdout/stderr library that'd write the text on screen.

Planned backends:
- Dreamcast (later on, maybe)

Console library TODO:
- Create a console structure that creates its own context and renders on top of the user output.
- Make it creatable/independent of RGFW_window and of createWindow init function.
