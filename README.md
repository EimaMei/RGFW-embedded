# RGFW Embedded
RGFW Embedded is an officially endorsed port of the RGFW library for embedded
systems, primarily consoles. The goal of this fork is to make the porting process of RGFW apps considerably easier on these archaic platforms
whilst making sure the library itself is tailored made for them. This means that
new features will be added unique to the base RGFW while some will be stripped
away or even removed.

RGFW Embedded **is not** a direct implementation of RGFW. It's a reimagining of
what RGFW could be like if it were on consoles.
